## 🚩 Phishing Indicators

| Indicator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **❌ Sender Domain Spoofing** | The email is sent from `@shared-document.com`, not a legitimate Monday.com domain (`@monday.com`). |
| **⚠️ Incomplete Team Name** | The phrase "Everyone at " is cut off, indicating a template failure or automation error—typical in phishing attempts. |
| **⚠️ Urgency and Pressure** | The line “Everyone else has already joined!” creates a false sense of urgency. |
| **❓ Unknown Link Destination** | The button “See the board now” does not display the real URL—raising suspicion of redirection to a malicious site. |
| **❌ No Personalization** | The email doesn't greet the recipient by name or mention any user-specific details. |
| **⚠️ Brand Imitation** | The email mimics Monday.com branding and logo to build trust—but without authentication. |

- Use an [email header analyzer](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx) to inspect technical authenticity.
- Verify with the real sender/company if the invitation is expected.
- Report the email to your internal security/IT team or email provider.
